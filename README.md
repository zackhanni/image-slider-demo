# image-slider-demo
 
things to improve upon
- make it automatically change images on a timer
- find out why i kave to add "center/cover fixed no-repeat" onto line 18 and 26 of app.js. can i have it adjust the image only and keep the other information there?
- try re-writing the app.js file. does the first function need to be set up like that? can im update the code or write it in my own/better way?
